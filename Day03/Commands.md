# Linux Commands in Kali Linux

There are some **important** _Linux commands_ that we have used in the _terminal_ in ***Kali Linux***, in which we could handle _files_ and _their permissions_, _move through directories_, et cetera. 

Below is a **table** of all the _commands_ we _tested_ in the terminal :-

| Command Keyword | Purpose of Command                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `ls`            | To list directory contents                            |
| `cd`            | To change the directory                               |
| `touch`         | To create a new empty file                            |
| `echo`          | To send a message in the terminal                     |
| `man`           | To display the manual for commands                    |
