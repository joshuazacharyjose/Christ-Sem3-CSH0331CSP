# *Introduction to Cybersecurity*

<ins>**Cybersecurity**</ins> is the _practice_ of **protecting systems, networks, and programs** from **digital attacks**, which are usually aimed at **accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information**. It involves _implementing_ a variety of **strategies, technologies, and practices** to ***safeguard*** digital assets and ensure the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** <ins>(CIA triad)</ins> of information.

This **concept** of cybersecurity is _essential_ for both **individuals _and_ organizations** in today's increasingly digital world. It helps in the _protection_ of **sensitive data** like **personal information, financial records, and intellectual property** from **theft, misuse, unauthorized access, et cetera**. It also _ensures_ **business continuity** by _minimizing_ the impact of **cyberattacks**, **protecting an organization's reputation**, and **helping them comply with data privacy regulations**. Strong cybersecurity measures _contribute_ to national security by **safeguarding critical infrastructure** like **power grids and financial systems**.
