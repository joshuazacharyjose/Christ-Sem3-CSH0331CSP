# *Introduction to Cybersecurity*

<ins>**Cybersecurity**</ins> is the _practice_ of **protecting systems, networks, and programs** from **digital attacks**, which are usually aimed at **accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information**. It involves _implementing_ a variety of **strategies, technologies, and practices** to ***safeguard*** digital assets and ensure the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** <ins>(CIA triad)</ins> of information.

This **concept** of cybersecurity is _essential_ for both **individuals _and_ organizations** in today's increasingly digital world. It helps in the _protection_ of **sensitive data** like **personal information, financial records, and intellectual property** from **theft, misuse, unauthorized access, et cetera**. It also _ensures_ **business continuity** by _minimizing_ the impact of **cyberattacks**, **protecting an organization's reputation**, and **helping them comply with data privacy regulations**. Strong cybersecurity measures _contribute_ to national security by **safeguarding critical infrastructure** like **power grids and financial systems**.

## What do we do in Cybersecurity

- Protect data
- Monitor networks
- Implement security features
- Conduct risk assesments
- Incident response
- Educate and train
- Stay updated

      - Defensive security
      - Infrastructure protection
      - Damage control
      - Incident response
      - Operational security
      - Threat hunters
      - Digital forensics
2. <ins>Red Team</ins>
      - Offensive security
      - Ethical hacking
      - Exploiting vulnerabilities
      - Penetration tools
      - Black box testing
      - Social engineering
      - Web app scanning
4. <ins>Purple Team</ins>
      - Facilitate improvements in detection and defence
      - Sharpen the skills of Blue and Red Teams' members
      - Effective for spot-checking systems in larger organisations

## Types of Cybersecurity Threats

1. <ins>Phishing</ins> <br>
      It is the practice of sending fradulent emails that resemble emails from reputable sources. The aim is to steal sensitive data like credit card numbers, login information, et cetera.
3. <ins>Ransomware</ins> <br>
       It is a type of malicious software (malware). It is designed to extort money by blocking access to files or the computer system until the ransom is paid.
4. <ins>Malware</ins> <br>
      It is a type of software designed to gain unauthorized access or to cause damamge to a computer.
5. <ins>Social Engineering</ins> <br>
      It is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access or valuables.
6. <ins>Man-in-the-Middle Attack</ins> <br>
      It is when a criminal interrupts the traffic between a two-part transaction.
7. <ins>Zero-Day Attack</ins> <br>
      It is a computer-software vulnerability either unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation, or known and without a patch to correct it.
